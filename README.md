# simple-room-automation-system

# Description
Design a simple room automation system that monitors both temperature, light level
and smoke in a room. If the system detects that temperature reaches 26Â°C it drives a fan
(DC motor) to run and the speed of rotation depends on room temperature(the more
temperature the more speed).
The system will also read light level and if there is a motion in the room it controls light
(LED) level according to luminance/darkness in room (the more darkness the more light
luminance). It is expected from the system to detect if there is a fire (smoke) in the
room and generate an alarm for the user. The user can also turn the system ON/OFF
using switch.

# Project Implementation:
Simulate the above design using TinkerCAD online simulator.
